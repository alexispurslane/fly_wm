# Simple script to build and run basic_wm in an Xephyr instance.

# 1. Build binary.
#
# To build with GCC/libstdc++:
#     scons --build_with=gcc basic_wm
# To build with Clang/libc++:
#     scons --build_with=clang basic_wm
scons --build_with=gcc basic_wm

# 2. Run.
#
# We need to specify the full path to Xephyr, as otherwise xinit will not
# interpret it as an argument specifying the X server to launch and will launch
# the default X server instead.
